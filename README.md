This project is called Google Homepage.

I will attempt to re-create the Google.co.uk homepage using HTML and CSS skills that I have learnt so far.

The start date of this project is 29/09/2018

This project was completed on 04/10/2018

Learning notes:

I started the project by doing what I could do comfortably without help. I built the initial html structure and linked the style.css file to the index.html file. 

I got stuck with some of the CSS so I finished the project with help from Google and looking at live examples. 

This has really cemented my knowledge about how html and css work together. It's given me experience using Chrome Developer Tools and using VSC.
